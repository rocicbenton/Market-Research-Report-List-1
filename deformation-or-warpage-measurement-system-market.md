<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deformation or Warpage Measurement System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-Type</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The deformation or warpage measurement system market is categorized into two primary types: contact-type and contactless systems. Contact-type systems involve direct physical interaction with the object being measured, using probes or gauges to assess surface irregularities. This method typically provides high accuracy but can potentially alter the object being tested. In contrast, contactless systems utilize optical or laser technologies to measure deformation from a distance, offering advantages in speed and non-invasiveness but may compromise on precision in complex geometries.</p></p>
